This is a web application deployed using local web server postman app. In this project, I have used Javascript, Nodejs, MongoDB as the database and the library used is Mongoose and Robo 3T as the GUI.
For security purposes, API authentication have been used. The operations that can be done using this application are login, sign up, task creation, logout, task updation and deletion.
I hope you find it helpful.
